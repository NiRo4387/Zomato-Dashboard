# Power BI Project Report - Zomato

## 1. Introduction
This project is a self-initiated data visualization and analysis task using the Zomato dataset. The objective was to explore restaurant data, extract meaningful insights, and create an interactive Power BI dashboard for effective data representation. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s capabilities, I aimed to understand trends in restaurant ratings, customer reviews, and online ordering patterns.

## 2. Dataset Overview
The Zomato dataset comprises various attributes related to restaurants, including:
- Restaurant Name
- Availability of Online Ordering facilities
- Facilities to book tables
- Ratings
- Number of Votes
- Location
- Restaurant Type (Casual Dining, Fine Dining, etc.)
- Average Cost for Two
- Restaurants listed as (Buffet, Cafes, etc.)
- City Restaurants listed in

Before the analysis, the data was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. The data was cleaned using Power Query and loaded into Power BI Windows software.

## 3. Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Excel for initial data exploration and cleaning.

## 4. Data Cleaning and Transformation
The raw dataset contained inconsistent and missing values. Key preprocessing steps included:
- Removing the duplicates
- Handling missing values in the 'Location' and 'Restaurants listed as' columns: As the missing data amounted to less than 1% of the total data, I decided to drop the missing data altogether.
- The 'Rating' column was converted from string datatype to numerical decimal

## 5. Dashboard Development
